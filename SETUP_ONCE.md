# üõ†Ô∏è One-Time Setup (Laptop)

Follow these steps once to prepare your laptop for the drone demo.

---

## 1. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal (e.g. CMD, PowerShell, or Terminal on Mac) and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NienkeDriessen/DroneSwarm.git
cd DroneSwarm
```

## 2. Install Python Requirements

Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed. Then, create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You're done! You only need to do this setup once per machine.
